**Start Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Strategy:** Clean restart from main with tested chunks  
**Reference:** `UTLS_INTEGRATION_RESEARCH.md` for full research

## Implementation Approach

**Ground Rules:**
1. ✅ 6 hours research : 1 hour implementation
2. ✅ Small, bite-sized chunks with tests
3. ✅ Long-term memory via .md files
4. ✅ Best possible quality code

**Testing Protocol:**
- **MUST test implant build after EVERY phase**
- **MUST verify implant runs** before moving to next phase
- **NO untested code stacking**

## Phase 1: Preparation ✅

### Goal:
Archive current broken branch, create clean branch from main, copy good artifacts.

### Actions Log:
