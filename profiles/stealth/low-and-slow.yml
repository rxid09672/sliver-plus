# Low-and-Slow Stealth Profile
# Minimal, infrequent traffic for maximum stealth
#
# Use Cases:
# - Long-term persistence
# - Evading behavioral analysis
# - Low-priority targets
# - Environments with anomaly detection
#
# Trade-offs:
# - Slower command execution
# - Reduced interactivity
# - Better OPSEC
